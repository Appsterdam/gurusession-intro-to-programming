### Lab/Self Guided Exercises

####Numbers
Write a program which tells you:

* how many hours are in a year?
* how many minutes are in a decade?
* how many seconds old are you?
* how many chocolates do you hope to eat in your life? 

Warning: This part of the program could take a while to compute!
Here's a tougher question:

* If I am 1031 million seconds old, how old am I?

####Methods
* Write a program which asks for a person's first name, then middle, then last. Finally, it should greet the person using their full name.
* Write a program which asks for a person's favorite number. Have your program add one to the number, then suggest the result as a bigger and better favorite number. (Do be tactful about it, though.)
